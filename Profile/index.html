        <p>Iam Self-driven person and I am  i am eager to deepen my skills and knowledge in software engineering.</p>
        <p>Although I am self-driven, the program also emphasized the importance of collaboration. Working alongside talented individuals in team settings taught me how to communicate effectively, share ideas, and learn from others. I realized that while individual effort is key, collaborative problem-solving and idea-sharing drive the best results.</p>
        <p>my expectation is to not only learn new technical skills but, also to gain hands on experience that will help me become more confident in my coding abilities.one of my longtime goal is to work with a leading teach company.</p>

        <h2>What I learnt</h2>
        <p>One of the key areas I have worked on is creating websites using *HTML* (Hypertext Markup Language) and *CSS* (Cascading Style Sheets). I have learned how to structure webpages, create content, and style them to create visually appealing and user-friendly designs. This skill is foundational for any web development project and has significantly improved my understanding of front-end development.</p>
